This project uses datasets of level of alcohol consumption by state (2002 - 2012) and reports of UFO sighitings by city (2002 - 2012) to visualize the pattern of UFO sightings by geographical region and by alcohol consumption level. 

Main libraries used are [d3.js](https://d3js.org) and [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com).
